# COVID-19 LSOA Risk Model 

The COVID-19 LSOA risk model project aims to infer the risk factors associated with COVID-19 incidence at the community (LSOA) level. Weekly COVID-19 incidence is modelled from April 2020 to the latest date for which data on the number of confirmed cases is available from NHS Test & Trace.

The model reports coefficient estimates for the features associated with COVID-19 incidence.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and install packages from the `requirements.txt` file

## Running the model

* Confirm that you have access to the required data sets, whose location is presented in Section A of the config file which can be found in `src` > `utils` > `config.py`

* Run the scripts from the `src` > `pipeline` folder in the following order:

1. 01_Preprocess.py
2. 02_Model.py
3. 03_Output.py

At the end of the `02_Model.py` script, the modelling results are written to the Google BigQuery locations specified in Section B of the config file.

The script `03_Output.py` wrangles the model results into a format for presentation on a [Google Data Studio dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8a6f31bd-1510-48dc-b314-f52419f75a3b/page/p_zxqqfjf9pc) which can be accessed by anyone with an @ons.gov.uk email address. If updating the dashboard is not a requirement for your use case, then it is not necessary to execute the `03_Output.py` script.
